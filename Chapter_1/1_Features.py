Python Features:
what is Features --> what special qualities in it like services OR facilities ,and those Features are used by 
language programmers for developing real time Application.

Python programming Features They  are :
-------------------------------------
1.simple
2.platform independent
3.Dynamically typed 
4.Interpreted
5.Freeware and open source
6.High level
7.Robust
8.Functional(procedure  oriented)and object oriented
9.Extensible
10.Embedded
11.supports Third party Modules such numpy, pandas, Matlotlib...etc


 

1.simple --->
--------
Python is a simple programing language because of Three important Technical Features 
They are:
1.Module : Any file(.py) having  of classes, functions, and variables are called module  
example : math, cmath, calender, these are modules of python 

2.Garbage collector : When we create variables or objects ,They use memory in 'RAM' .when those variables are no longer 
needed the Garbage collector automatically removes space to them and delete's.only the delete string character available 
space is gives to it.So the Garbage collector is Automatically works in python.

3.python programing lang provides User-friendly syntaxes.less lines and less time it takes.

========================================================================================================================

2.platform Independent--->
----------------------
python is a plotform Independent programming language because The python program works on all operating systems(OS).

In plotform Independent created some programing languages that some programing languages works on any OS ,without 
changinng anything,Because they  have interpreter like JVM and PVM they take souce code to intermediate code and by 
using PVM translate to the machine understandable language (1,0) Binary language.

========================================================================================================================

3.Dynamically Typed--->
In this we have two types they are :
1.static Typed programing lang
2.Dynamically Typed programing language

->static Tyeped : when we create a variable and gives the value to that variable At that time only we mention that variable 
type and give the value then only the value get,otherwise we get Error .This is called static Typed programing lang.
Example : int a = 10 
          int b = 20 
          int c = a+b
          here we declare the variables ,that is which data type is.
          
->Dynamically Typed : We Don't need to mention any data type to the variables python automatically converts the value 
to it's related Data type.So the python is Automatcally converting variable given value into it's type of datatype.
This is called Dynamically Typed programming language.
Example: a = 10 
         b = 20
         c = 2.4
         d = a+b+c
    
========================================================================================================================

3.Interpreted programming---> 
-------------------------
When we develop amy  python program ,we must give some file name with an extension (.py) filename.py).
--python is interpreted programing language ,It can runs on any operating systems.  
--When we execute python program ,two process taken place internqally
a)compilation process
b)Execution process

(a)->compilation process: source code (python programming)use as(.py) python having for this soure code one python compiler
it reads line by line to check the mistakes.And sends to the byte code.The source code converted to byt code it is called
Intermediate code.

(b)->Excecution process:When we taken the souce code into bytecode (.pyc).At that time PVM works on bytecode read 
line by line and send it to the machine understandable language ,computer language (0,1)binary code which is understandable
by OS and processor and gives the Result.


4.Freeware and open source--->
--------------------------
Freeware : Freeware means the software is free to use ,but we can not see or change the source code.
-Download it for free
-Install and use it without paying
-we can not see program code(source code)
-we can not modify  the code
-we can not Redistribute modify the code

Freeware examples:
-Google chrome
-zoom free 

Open source : open source means the source code is open for everyone to see,use,modify,and share
-you can see the full code 
-modify and improve it
-share your modification 
-use it in your own projects 


5. High level programming--->
-------------------------
1.low level  programming languages
2.High level programmig languages

low level : computer understandable  language

high level : high level programming language is used in programs (source code) .it is user frienly languages. 



6.Robust(strong)--->
---------------
Robust means strong,stable,and error tolerate ,so  python can handle error,safely, avoid crashes, and keep the program 
running smothly.
Robust is use to not crash the program and it use the "Exception handling" 
Exception handling -- the  process converting technical error message into user-friendly error message is called 
"exception handling".



7.Extensible--->
------------
Extensible means python provided Built-in modules to use other programing languages, And this type of providing service  
to others called Extensible.

8.Embedded--->
----------
Embedded means python programming will uses other language sevices/libraries also.In other words ,we call other language 
code inside of python program and hence python programing lang is Embedded programing language.
