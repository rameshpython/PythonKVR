Data Representation:
-------------------
-->What is Data
---------------
-The processed information is called Data.
-The purpose of collection data is that " To take effective Decisions".
-The data always stored in main memory 'RAM',PROCESSED in main memory and results displayed on the monitor.
-And to store data permanently we use secondary memory hard disk,DVD,pen drives etc.
-The structured format is called as DATA ,  Whereas unstructured format is called information.

-->what  is structured and unstructured data:
--------------------------------------------
-One purpose of 'Data science' is to  structure Data,making it iterable(meaningful) and easy to work with it .

-Data can be categorized into two types:
->structured data
->unstructured data

->unstructured data
 ------------------
 -unstructured data is not organized ,we must organize the data for analysis purposes.
 -it is not in position of  correct form to use .it is just information but not it is in positional.
 ex: O   0
     O O 0
     0 0 0
       0

 ->structured data
   ---------------
-structured data is organized and easier to work with.
ex: 0 0 0
    0 0 0
    0 0 0

-->How to structure a Data?
-We can use an Array or a database table (rows and columns) to structure or present data.

example of am array:
-------------------
[80,36,78,98,87,94,92,123,342,125]

-The following example shows how to create an Array in python.



-->Types of literals or values:
------------------------------
->In python programming ,Broadly ,literals or values classified into 5 Types.They are
1.Integer literals
2.string literals
3.float literals
4.Boolean literals
5.collection literals

->All the literals are called "Data" and need to store in main memeory.


-->Importance of Identifiers OR variables
-----------------------------------------
- In any programming language literals or values Must be stored in main memory by allocating sufficient amount
of memory space with the help of Data types.
-for storing value we need space for that value , We giving one identity to store value, that  storing name called as
variable
-we know that all types of literals are stored in main memory by having memory space .
-To process value which are present in memory space ,programmers must give DISTINCT NAMES to the created memory spaces
that DISTINCT NAME is called identifier.
-The identifier values are changing during program execution and hence identifiers are also called variables.
-Hence all types of literals are stored in the form variables and all variables are called objeccts.

-->Definition of variable:
-------------------------
-A variable is an identifier whose value can be changed during program Execution.
-when we give the variable and its value ,the value of variable we can change and assign to the same variable another
values also.
-In the place of variable we mention our way of name to the variable .
